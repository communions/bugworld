Each Layer has notable figures and factions. Heaven mainly consists of noble families and government bodies, with the occasional high ranking doctor. Naturally, Purgatory has a few celebrities that influence life on that layer. Some are even sponsored by Heaven. Hell is also home to quite the scene of celebrities, and on top of that has a thriving underbelly of crime. And where there's crime, there is massively influential crime families and syndicates.
